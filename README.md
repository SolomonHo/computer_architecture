This is the coursework for the 113-1 Computer Architecture course, including simple algorithms implemented using assembly language with a stack, as well as the final project, which implements a single-cycle CPU in Verilog based on what was learned in class.

## Final_Project (Verilog)
- Implemented a single-cycle CPU based on class material.

## RISC-V Projects (Assembling)
- hw1: Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- hw2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- hw3: Floydâ€™s cycle-finding
